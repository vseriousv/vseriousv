## Hi, I'm Kirill Gavrilov

I'm an engineer. I love technology of any kind.

I've been CTO of one of the world's top-5 centralized crypto exchanges, CTO at Rivo.xyz (one-click DeFi investing), and Lead Backend at multiple Web3 projects on Waves blockchain. Worked as Lead Engineering at GetBlock.io — blockchain node infrastructure provider.

Built AlmazVPN — a Telegram-based VPN service that grew into a B2B solution. Sold 90% of the project and continued as CTO.

In 2024 I left employment and chose entrepreneurship. Now I build products alone. With AI.

I believe software architecture is the last skill AI won't replace. AI can write code, but it can't decide how systems should talk to each other, where data should live, or what to do when everything falls apart at 3 AM.

That's what I'm focused on: architecture decisions in the age of vibe coding.

### What I'm Building

**MindPost** — content automation platform. 5 microservices, Event-Driven Architecture, built from scratch with AI.

**DzinDzon** — mobile video calls app with real-time communication.

**Payment System** — universal payment infrastructure for all my projects. 6 Go microservices communicating through NATS, zero direct dependencies between services.

### What I Write About

I run a Telegram channel about Software Architecture — real decisions from real projects, engineering analogies, and honest failures. No tutorials, no fluff.

### Stack

Go · TypeScript · Next.js · PostgreSQL · Redis · NATS · Docker · Kubernetes · Ansible
